# LEGO_IDEAS_2020
This is my first code in Python, it was made to create an interactive advent calendar with Lego Mindstorms.

This robot was born out of the desire to have an advent calendar despite the covid (which made it impossible to choose a traditional advent calendar).

Its name was chosen as a wordplay between Natale (which means Christmas in Italian),  Christmas Eve, and ev3.

It is made out of two Ev3 bricks to add more interactions (one acts as the server and the other one acts as the client - they communicate with each other via Bluetooth) but the main functions of this robot can be done using only one brick.

The way the server was constructed makes it customisable as it can be extended horizontally and vertically without having to rebuild everything. Once built, it can be used as such but what's funnier than customising it ?
That's why I've chosen to build a house with vintage bricks around it but any type of house, or a castle could be built too.

The client was built to fit the chocolate.
